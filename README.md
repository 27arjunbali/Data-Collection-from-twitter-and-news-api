# Data-Collection-from-twitter-and-news-api
First I made a twitter app and provide it the domain from hostinger.
After this i used tweepy library to work with data from twitter api, as the data collected was directly stored in mongodb and the
parsing the 5 most frequently occuring named-entities we also taken.
The news is also collected by using libraries that are must to do with this and the news retrieved is made into a dataset of csv format.
As I have used tqdm library in the process i used newspaper3k also but my work was done using tqd and api keys from twitter and newsapi.
The work that was confusing was to get the data from mongodb and after that only i can do the analysis.
